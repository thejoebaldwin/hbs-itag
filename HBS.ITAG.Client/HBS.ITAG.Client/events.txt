This has traditionally been a hodgepodge of physical devices from multiple vendors. VMware's NSX brings network security into the virtualization environment with an easy to understand and manage interface. Special hardware administration skills are not needed. This is all managed from an interface you are already familiar with. Connect your Software Defined Network to your core network and go. This session will explore Software Defined Networking and how it can provide you a compliant and easy to manage network.","track_id":"0"},{"name":"Securing it All - Using NSX to Secure your Environment","event_id":"2","start_time":"2017-06-08T18:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-08T19:15:00.000Z","presenter":"Joe Desmond, SR Systems Engineer VMware","summary":"Securing data is more important than ever today.

This session will introduce basic Python programming constructs such as variable, logical conditions, and looping.
